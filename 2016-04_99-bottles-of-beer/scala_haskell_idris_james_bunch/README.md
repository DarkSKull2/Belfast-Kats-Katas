A few different attempts to try different approaches/languages out:

* Scala: one using flatMap, one with recursion. Tested based on comparison with an 'oracle' (text file)
* Haskell: bind pattern matching functions over a list. Simple hunit tests.
* Idris: Partially complete. Idea is to see how dependent types might remove the need for some tests... proofs > tests?
